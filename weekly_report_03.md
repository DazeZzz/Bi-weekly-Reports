# Fortnightly Report 03

**The first week:**\
In the first half of the week, I mainly spent my time helping my senior colleague to write database algorithms and run data.\
In the second half of the week, I was mainly working on the final assignment for the `Advanced Programming for Linux Environment` course. I became familiar with C++ file streams and gained a deeper understanding of thread pools.

**The second week:**\
In the first half of the week, I was mainly fixing the code bugs of the CMU-15445 project. And in this process, I have a deeper understanding of the `RAII` in C++.\
In the second half of the week, I finished the `Experimental Report` of `Distributed course final assignment`, and after that, I began to review `distributed systems` for the upcoming final exam. I plan to review this course carefully to prepare for MIT6.824.

**Other:**\
In addition to the above work, I also finished the the book `Effective Modern C++`, and I begin to read a book called `Functional Programming in C++`.
