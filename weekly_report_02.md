# Fortnightly Report 02

The first week I did some optimization of the code from the previous `CMU-15445` project, and I got to the `query plan` part of the `CMU-15445` course video. In addition, I read a book called `C++ Concurrency In Action`. I learned how to write the thread safe data structure in this book, including the ways that need to be implemented with and without locks. The `free-lock` implementation involves various `C++ atomic operations` and `memory ordering`. I also learned how to write a thread pool in this book and implemented a thread pool.

The next week I read part of a paper on database storage, and learned one of the algorithms in this paper. I modified some code on this algorithm and did some test on the code. Besides, I am reading a book called `modern effective C++`, and I learned a lot from the book's introduction to some of the features of modern C++.
